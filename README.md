# TDOA-Hydrophones
In several underwater robotics competitions, localization of pinger in the water body is one of the essential and very challenging tasks underwater. This projects aim at competing this task using MATLAB and Signal Processing Libraries.

For MATLAB Simulations
----------------------
1. DSP system toolbox
2. Phased Array System Toolbox

for Real Time Application Following are required

Currently the project is made to perform in realtime using follows

Hardware
----------
1. Instrumentational Amplifiers
2. SAR based ADCs (18 bit)
3. Rpi 3b

Libaries Used
-----------
1. bcm2835 ( for ADC interfacing SPI code )
2. liquid_dsp library( for signal processing )
3. FFTW-3.3.8 library( for signal processing )
